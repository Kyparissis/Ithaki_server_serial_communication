This Network Programming Assignment aims at:
- Developing an experimental network application using Java.
- Learning about the mechanisms of the asynchronous serial communications in practice.
- Collecting statistical measurement values of some parametres that contribute, simultaneously with other, at the configuration of the communication quality on real-life computer communication channels.    


For this assignment we used the virtual modem [Ithaki-Smart-Modem](https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/lib/ithakimodem.jar) to communicate with the virtual lab of this course.    
The object class ```Modem.class```  provided by Ithaki's web server allows the serial communication of a PC with a local virtual modem and through that the communication with Ithaki's server using a typical Internet connection (Not a dialup DSL connection).   
      
       
In the `UserApplication.java`:
- We create this modem object using the `ithakimodem.jar`'s `Modem.class`:   
```Modem VirtualModem = new Modem();```     
- Set the Virtual Modem's **SPEED** and **TIMEOUT**.   
- Dial-up Ithaki using the code: `"ATD2310ITHAKI"`, since the modem is now in *COMMAND MODE*   
(This also sets the modem into *DATA MODE*, allowing us to use every type of command)   
- Test the connection to the modem by typing `"TEST"` and expect this output:   
`PSTART DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS ITHAKI JAVA LAB SERVER TEST PSTOP`   
, where ***DD-MM-YYYY*** is the date and ***HH-MM-SS*** the time the test packet was sent from the server.  

- Then, as asked, we:
   - Use the ```echo_request_code``` code to receive Echo type packets for at least 4 minutes, parse them and then calculate the system's response time.   
Then we create a scatter chart, using MS Excel, to analyse our system.   
Echo type packets have the following format: `PSTART DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM-SS PC PSTOP` ,   
where ***DD-MM-YYYY*** is the date and ***HH-MM-SS*** the time the packet was sent from the server and ***PC*** a packet counter%100.   
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/echoExample2.jpg" alt="Echo packets Samples">

   - Use the ```image_request_code_withoutErrors``` code to receive **ERROR-FREE** *.jpg* images taken by the virtual lab's `VideoCoder` (Hosted at http://ithaki.eng.auth.gr/netlab/video.html) of a camera placed on a road near the School Of Engineering of Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki.  
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/errorFreeExample.jpg" alt="Error-free image sample">    
   - Use the ```image_request_code_withErrors``` code to receive *.jpg* images taken by the virtual lab's `VideoCoder` (Hosted at http://ithaki.eng.auth.gr/netlab/video.html) (Those images have **ERRORS** on them) of a camera placed on a road near the School Of Engineering of Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki.  
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/errorExample.jpg" alt="Error image sample"> 
   - Use the ```gps_request_code``` code to receive [NMEA Protocol](http://www.nmea.org/) ( Global Positioning System Fix Data, *$GPGGA* ) GPS points' packets from a pre-saved route, parse those point's packets and find at least 4 points with distance of at least 4'' between the one to the next one.
Those NMEA Protocol GPS type packets format can be found [**HERE**](http://ithaki.eng.auth.gr/netlab/sirf-nmea-reference-manual.pdf) *(Page 13)*.   
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/GPSExample.jpg" alt="GPS packets Samples">   
Then we request an image/screenshot from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), pin-pointing those points, from Ithaki using a `T=AABBCCDDEEZZ` parameter generated by our algorithm (Point's Latitude: *AA°BB'CC''* and Longitude: *DD°EE'ZZ''*) and the SAME function we created to receive images from Ithaki before (The *T=* parameter can be repeated 9 times after the ```gps_request_code```).  
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/GPSImageExample.jpg" alt="GPS image sample">   
   - Use the two ```ack_result_code``` and ```nack_result_code``` codes to receive ARQ type packets for at least 4 minutes, parse them and then uses an ARQ - Stop and Wait algorithm to check for errors and either re-requests the same packet or requests a new one, by comparing the *FCS* value with the result of the *XOR* operator applied to the pseudoencrypted message/string, of the packet, sequentially.   
Then, also, calculate the system's response time.   
Then we create a scatter chart, using MS Excel, to analyse our system.   
Also then we create a histogram, using MS Excel, to find the probability distribution of the number of re-requests per packet, due to errors.   
ARQ type packets have the following format: `PSTART DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM-SS PC <ΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧ> FCS PSTOP`   
,where ***DD-MM-YYYY*** is the date and ***HH-MM-SS*** the time the packet was sent from the server, ***PC*** a packet counter%100, *ΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧΧ* is the pseudoencrypted message/string and *FCS* the Frame Check Sequence's Decimal Value.   
Example:   
      <img src="https://github.com/Kyparissis/Networks1-2022-Assignment/blob/main/reports/media/other/ARQExample.jpg" alt="ARQ packets samples">   
Finally, we find the ***Bit Error Rate (BER)*** of the ARQ type packets we received during this time.   
   
- At last, we save/store the request codes we used, the time we executed each application and the full console output into *.txt* files.   
    
*( The request codes are provided by [Ithaki's webserver](http://ithaki.eng.auth.gr/netlab/index.html) and are valid for a 2-hour session. )*
